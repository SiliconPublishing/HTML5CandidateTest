# HTML5CandidateTest
Test for potential HTML5 developers

# Instructions
Create a RESTful API in nodeJS to deliver manifest.XML and layout_1.xml. Request signatures can be anything you like. Please use GET or POST requests.
In the client application, use the response which delivers the manifest.XML document to load layout_1.xml
Provide some kind of visualization of the page items found in layout_1.xml. This could be as simple as a textual list, or as complex as creating DOM elements to display the data.
The application should be data driven
The application should demonstrate your knowledge of OOP including the creation of objects, object extension, and separation of concerns using good encapsulation
DRY code is appreciated
Anonymous function are frowned upon

# Rules
You can use any resource you like, take as much time as you like (within reason), and incorporate any third party libraries or frameworks you like. We do appreciate native JavaScript more than the use of third party libraries to some extent.
